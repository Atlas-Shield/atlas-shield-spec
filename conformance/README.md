# conformance/
Conformance test descriptions and expected behaviors.

## Layout
- `cases/` — human-readable test specs (YAML/MD)
- `expected/` — canonical outcomes (pass/fail, severity, rationale)
- `runner/` (later) — optional scripts to execute tests

Goal: verify implementations conform to the spec and policy semantics.
